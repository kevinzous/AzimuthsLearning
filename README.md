# AzimuthsLearning

A list of resources that I found very useful:

## 1- Learning Ressources
### 1-a) Courses, ebooks (links or github repo)
[amitness/learning](https://github.com/amitness/learning): github repo containing a quite exhaustive list of online courses + some e-books 

[ossu/data-science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science#curriculum): 
github repo

[EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books):github repo

[Mathematics for machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): ebook on mathematics for ML

[Tensorflow](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/): crash course by Google 

- [ ] [CS 20: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html): MOOCS 

- [x] [Machine Learning, Stanford, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learninfg/home/welcome) <br />
**Pros** : <br />
-one of the first and best courses in ML <br />
-theory-driven and in-depth coverage of algorithms <br />
**Cons** : <br />
-taught in Matlab/Octave (more research-oriented language than Python) <br />
-course made in 2011, no cutting-edge/industry-standard applications using ML <br />
**Useful resources section**: [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/resources/NrY2G) <br />
-Informative Web Sites <br />
-Machine Learning Data Sets <br />
-Useful papers <br />
**Assignment and Project solutions** : [repo link](https://github.com/kevinzous/AzimuthsLearning/tree/master/MOOCS2_Deep_Learning_Deeplearningai) <br />
- [x] [Neural Networks and Deep Learning, deeplearning.ai, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) in python <br />
**Assignment and Project solutions**: [repo link](https://github.com/kevinzous/AzimuthsLearning/tree/master/MOOCS1_Machine%20Learning_Stanford)
