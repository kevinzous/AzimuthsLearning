A list of resources that I found very useful:

## 1-Learning (courses, ebooks..) 
[amitness/learning](https://github.com/amitness/learning): github repo containing a quite exhaustive list of online courses + some e-books 

[ossu/data-science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science#curriculum): 
github repo

[EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books):github repo

[Mathematics for machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): ebook on mathematics for ML

[Tensorflow](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/): crash course by Google 

[CS 20: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html): MOOCS 


☑ [Machine Learning, Stanford, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learninfg/home/welcome) <br />
Pros : <br />
-one of the first and best courses in ML <br />
-theory-driven and in-depth coverage of algorithms <br />
Cons : <br />
-taught in Matlab/Octave (more research oriented language) <br />
-courses made in 2011, no cutting-edge/industry-standard applications using ML <br />


☑ [Neural Networks and Deep Learning, deeplearning.ai, Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) in python

## 2-Cheat sheets
