a) ADAM
i. Momentum : running average of gradients
* reduce variance and oscillation (if learning step is big) allowing faster convergence 

ii. ADAM: running average of gradients (m) + running average of magnitudes OF gradients (v)
* Benefits of momentum
* updates divided by sqrt(v) : if learning rate is high, it scales it down and otherwise if learning is stuck (low v), it makes it bigger.
=> adaptative learning rates 


b) dropout 
i. gamma = 1/ (1-pdrop) because E(d) = 0*pdrop + 1*(1-pdrop)
ii. dropout prevent overfitting => only happens at training. We only apply at training times

a)
Stack :[ROOT, parsed, this]
Buffer : [sentence, correctly]
Transition : SHIFT

Stack :[ROOT, parsed, this, sentence]
Buffer : [correctly]
Transition :  SHIFT

Stack :[ROOT, parsed, sentence]
Buffer : [correctly]
New dependency : this<-sentence
Transition :  LEFT-ARC

Stack :[ROOT, parsed]
Buffer : [correctly]
New dependency : parsed->sentence
Transition :  RIGHT-ARC

Stack :[ROOT, parsed, correctly]
Buffer : []
Transition :  SHIFT

Stack :[ROOT, parsed]
Buffer : []
New dependency : parsed->correctly
Transition :  RIGHT-ARC

Stack :[ROOT]
Buffer : []
New dependency : ROOT->parsed
Transition :  RIGHT-ARC

buffer is empty and stack size one=> the iteration stops

b) Given n words, we have n steps of arc operations and n steps of shift opertions = 2n in total
